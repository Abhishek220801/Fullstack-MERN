    <h1>Interview Questions Day 2</h1>

    <h3>Q1. Difference between HTML tags and elements?</h3>
    <p>HTML tags define the structural elements of a document, like < h1> for headings. Elements comprise both an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, enclosed within < and > symbols. These tags delineate the beginning and end of an HTML element.</p>

    <h3>Q2. Explain br tag</h3>
    <p>The < br> tag is self-closing, which means it doesn't need a corresponding closing tag. Web browsers do not inherently understand line breaks or paragraph structure, making the < br> tag essential for defining manual line breaks in HTML.</p>

    <h3>Q3. Explain how many different types of lists we have in html.</h3>
    <p>In HTML, there are two main types of lists that you are used to organize content:
<br>    <ol>
    <li>Ordered lists: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Ordered lists are used when the sequence of items is important, such as steps in a recipe or items in a numbered list.</li>
        <li>Each item in an ordered list is marked with a number or another type of ordered marker (such as letters or Roman numerals).</li><br>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Unordered lists: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered lists are used when the order of items is not important, such as a list of features or bullet points.</li>
            <li>Each item in an unordered list is typically marked with a bullet point (or another type of unordered marker like a square or circle).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Q4. What are semantic tags?</h3>
    <p>Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. 
        <br>for example, tags like header tag, article tag, and footer tag are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. </p>

        <h3>Q5. Write code to create an ordered list with roman numbers.</h3>
        <p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Piano</li>
                <li>Guitar</li>
                <li>Ukulele</li>
                <li>Banjo</li>
                <li>Drums</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Q6. Write code to create an unordered list with circle.</h3>
        <p>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Lemon Tea</li>
                <li>Mojito</li>
                <li>Fruit Deer</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
